	* Choose home islands one by one for each tribe for better control
	* Each home island should have at least 2 uninhabited islands within its reach
	* For each home island there shouldn't be other home islands within its reach
* Gameplay
	* Sending settlers costs gold: fixed value + proportionally to the size of the fleet + equipment price
	* A fleet needs "colonization kit" to colonize an uninhabited island
	* Island assaults
* Refactoring

	* After a fleet arrives settlers should be "dropped" separately to deplay an assault, a colony foundation etc.
* UI
	* When an island is selected show all player's fleets moving to this island
* Bugfixing
